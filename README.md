# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis.
# Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of this analysis was twofold: firstly, to further understand the magnitude of the upcoming "silver tsunami" on a departmental level at Pewlett Hackard, and secondly, to begin fleshing out a mentorship program that would allow for a smoother transition as the younger replacements take over for the employees that're aging out.  By breaking down the upcoming rash of retirements by department, Pewlett Hackard (PH) will be able to know not only skillsets they need to look for in new hires, but also 

# Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

# Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

# How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

# Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
